Removing hit type streak is not a change, it is set in the weapon, and isn't set at ammo level in standard iATM ammo! Might be a fix for it accidentally still being streak in Indirect mode if Ammo level takes precidence over Mode.

Launcher max range stat fixed. 
Unused F. ATM missile HP type fixed from 3 to 4.
iATM missile HP type fixed from 3 to 5.
Damage mod stats for special ammo updated to current balance for mainline ammo.

Fixed Odd size protomech SRM max range.
Fixed odd size protomech LRM max range.

Made protomech cores cheaper, a canonical correction:
Tech Manual says protomech engines cost "(5,000 x Engine Rating x Unit Tonnage) รท 75 "
Which would then be multiplied by 5 because we only put one item for the 5 squad members. 
I used 15 tons for the unit weight, the maximum. Engine prices still decreased by 60% or more.
Similar to my revision of BA this will make the basic ones a little cheaper.
