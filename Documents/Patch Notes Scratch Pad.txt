1.3.0

Dev Commentary: Significant Rework of Battle Armor Items. They're cheaper and better.

Price of BA Jumpjets cut by 66%. Price of many of their weapons and items have been reduced, some slightly other significantly. You may find it easier to purchase battle armor or maintain the squads you have.
BA weapons upgraded. Their missile packs now have the full range of their mech-scale counterparts. The same goes for their lasers, if it has the same name as a mech weapon it has the same stats.
All of the weapons unique to Battle armor have also recieved fixes, tweaks and improvements. 90% of these changes are direct Tabletop rules compliance. A few are to match Roguetech balance concerns.

When we first made battle armor we gave their weapons unlimited ammo for simplicity. 
Later on weapons we added had limited shots. Leading to some weirdness.
This update brings consistency and makes all their non-laser and PPC weapons have limited ammo.

SAR:

It's miserable.
No salvage. None. You gotta scoot. No one is giving any support while you scavenge the field.
No pay. You have no employer. It's your company financing a run to get your pilot back. Secondary objectives for cash may offset costs.
How can you do this mission more cheaply and efficiently?

Tweaks to enemy force composition on Rescue type SAR, setting one to always be a Mixed lance of mechs and vehicles.

BUT! Base pilot recovery chance up from 50% to 60%, Recovery chance on a planet your employer owns up from 75% to 80%

Escort type: 
Primary blocking force lance template changed from Battle to Cavalry.
Ambush lance added while convoy is enroute.
Hunter lance after convoy arrives at pickup point removed. 
Moving to a player extraction point is no longer a primary objective; 
Mission ends after the pilot extracts.

Weapons:
Bomb FAE [WM] - Removed Bonus to TAC chance.
Ammo LongTom Thermobaric - Removed Bonus to TAC chance.

Thunderbolt HE (ALL) - Description fixes
Thermobolt (ALL) - Nerfs!

Inf Mine Bombs (All) - Mine damage: -1 AOE damage +1 standard damage. Added Description for Standard damage. Added descriptions for always causing fires.

(Note on these TAC changes: Fixes ancient misunderstanding/miscalculation on Cargo's part. At some point I forgot TAD weapons that are also supposed to easily get TAC can't do it if their APMaxArmorThickness is too low. This actually puts them on parity with Tandem Rockets for this stat. AC/20 already has enough and could crit armor 400 thick.)
Ammo AC/2 [AP] - Bonus to max armor depth able to TAC from +50 to +200
Ammo AC/5 [AP] - Bonus to max armor depth able to TAC from +90 to +200
Ammo AC/10 [AP] - Bonus to max armor depth able to TAC from +120 to +200
Ammo RAC/2 [AP] - Bonus to max armor depth able to TAC from +30 to +200
Ammo RAC/5 [AP] - Bonus to max armor depth able to TAC from +60 to +200

HVAC (ALL) - Hyper-Velocity Autocannons. Altered description to clarify that misfire chance is mitigated by Gunnery and reduce redundancy.
Fixed slightly wrong TAC values on about 20 autocannons.
Many clan weapons increased in price, to twice as expensive as IS equivilents.

Design Mask / Terrain / Combat :

Forest - Stability Damage +30% to +10%
Burning Forest - Stability Damage +30% to +10%
Burned Forest - Stability Damage +15% to +10%

(Internal note. Change to DesignMaskBurningTerrain is to undo an ancient attempt to get vehicles to path around fire. Units understand damaging terrain directly now. This should be redundant. This may not be noticable or explicable to players.)

Vehicle Traits:

Micro - Is now a structure type for vehicles under 5 tons, like UAVs.

Vehicles:

Cornerstone - New, RT Custom. 150 Ton SH. The Cornerstone project was intended to produce a defense tank that could be a bulwark around which other elements of a unit could rally while it delivered a steady stream of support fire. As such it was a moderate success. But critics were quick to point out that perhaps the duties of a line tank could be done more efficiently by existing MBT, and a superheavy chassis might have been better used to mount an exceptional weapon system like a railgun.
Warthog HOG-AGR - New, RT Custom. Silver Bullet Gauss carrying version of the hard-to-kill flier.
Warthog HOG-RC2 - New, RT Custom. Twin RAC/2 carrying version of the hard-to-kill flier.


Warthog VTOL (ALL) - Fly height reduced from 45 to 25 meters for better use of cover by this slow "tank."
