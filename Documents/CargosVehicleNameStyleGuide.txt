Vehicle naming style guide:

Vehiclechasssisdef "Name" field only: "[Name] [Role]" - See notes on standard base model below.

Vehicledef, "UIName" and "Name" fields and Vehiclechassisdef UIName field: 

Preferably use model number if available, or make up plausible alphanumeric for that vee family and variant: 

"[Name] [Alphanumeric]" e.g. "Tokugawa TKG-153", "Hunter HNT-3R"


Second choice, faster, easier, abstracted:

If standard base model: "[Name] [Role]" - eg "Rommel Heavy Tank", "Yellowjacket Gunship", "Turhan APC". Stated role should be generally applicable to all or most variants, and particularly the base model.

If Variant: "[Name] ([short meta description])" - e.g. "Condor (Laser)", "Rhino (Flamer)" This is the old way, with descriptive variant names, or occasionally introduction years.

If Omni base model: "[Name] Prime" - e.g. "Epona Prime"

If Omni variant: "[Name] [Letter]" - e.g. "Epona A", (Some families stylized with an O or 0 for Omni with the letter. e.g. "Fujin 0A")

If Omni has alphanumeric as above but include before the letter, separated with a dash. e.g. "Epona Pone-A"
