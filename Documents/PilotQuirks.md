# Pilot Quirk Guide

This guide outlines usages of the various pilot quirks when making pilots.

## Standard Quirks

All standard quirks live in MechAffinity's `QuirkDefs` directory. These quirks may be used for any pilots you may be making without general restrictions.

you should of course not be overly generous when creating new pilots and each should only have a handful of quirks assigned to them. somewhat special consideration should be taken for quirks
like pain shut or neural implants given they are meant to be rare, but otherwise no permissions are required to use these perks.


## RTO Quirks

All Normal RTO quirks live in MechAffinity's `RtoQuirkDefs` directory. These quirks are generally speaking fairly powerful or have unique mechanics tied to them. These quirks are meant to only be used on the pilots
they were specifically made for and are not be used on any other ronin.

The only time these quirks may be used outside of the pilot they were build for is on random assignment to Kill Team pilot via Quirk Pools


## RTO Shared Quirks

This class of quirks lives in MechAffinity's `RtoSharedQuirkDefs` directory. These quirks are awarded to RTO pilots for meeting certain game or event conditions. They are never to be used outside of RTO or 
Crew-Level pilots. They are meant to be badges of honour, they may not be used for any other purpose. Acquiring these quirks is not meant to be easy and may only be awarded by RTO server admins.


## Crew Quirks

These quirks live in MechAffinity's `CrewQuirkDefs` directory. They are to only ever be used on the crew pilot they were created for, They may not be used elsewhere.


## RTO Shared Quirks

This class of quirks lives in MechAffinity's `CrewSharedQuirkDefs` directory. These quirks are shared amongst Crew pilots, denoting their primary roles within the crew, they are not be used outside of crew pilots
