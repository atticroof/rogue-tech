The honours are yours.\"\r\n\r\nSumire reaches out and pushes the button on the console.  An audible click sounds, along with a number of whirring fans.  The console's screen flickers before focusing and revealing the display where a large blinking <color=#FF0000>ACTIVATE?</color> pulses.\r\n\r\nSumire looks at you, \"It appears to be working so far, Commander.

Occasional beeps sound from the console.\r\n\r\nYou look at Sumire, \"Now what?\"\r\n\r\nSumire smiles, \"Now we let it calculate any possible Pirate Points related to the systems stored in our navigation computer and our current position.  The beeps means it has stored the temporary coordinates for a system.  It will send those coordinates to the JumpShip when we dock with it.\"\r\n\r\nYou cross your arms in front of you and smile, \"Sounds good.
