As such, {COMPANY.CompanyName} is being issued a Non-Compliance of By-Laws ruling and\u2026</i></color>\r\n\r\nYou stop reading there, noting the additional 36 pages in the message, and toss the datapad on the desk, \u201CJust sum it up for me Darius.\u201D\r\n\r\nDarius picks up the pad, \u201CWell, basically we have been reported for using the Console to trick those jumpships into arriving at Pirate Points. The main issue is more related to the misjumps we have had then the actual use of Pirate Points, so now the CJSTA wants compensation.\u201D\r\n\r\nYou cup your chin with your thumb and forefinger, \u201CSo, what's the bottom line?\u201D\r\n\r\nDarius scrolls through a few pages, \u201CWe have two options here:\r\n\r\n\r\n We can opt to pay the fine as a lump sum now or agree to a slight increase to our Jumpship costs.\u201D\r\n\r\nDarius looks up from the datapad and awaits your decision.",
