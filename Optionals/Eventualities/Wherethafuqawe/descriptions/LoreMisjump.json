    "Name" : "Misjump",
    "Details" : "A misjump can occur because of miscalculations, technical problems, or spatial anomalies, causing the JumpShip to deviate from its intended destination and emerge off course and often also causing damage to the K-F drive in the process and sometimes to the crew and cargo the JumpShip is carrying. Errors are typically in terms of kilometers or astronomical units, but misjumps of light-years have occurred. Sometimes ships end up in a different star system than the one that they intended to jump to, or stranded in deep space. Misjumps have even been known to move ships far beyond the threshold of 30 light-years in rare instances: The accidental discovery of Alfirk occurred due to a misjump that carried the ship across at least 600 light-years in a single jump; similarly, the wreckage of the Liberator was found over 350 light-years from its last known position.",
