    "Details" : "There are some nonstandard jump points that will allow a JumpShip to enter a system inside the proximity limit. As these points are much closer to the habitable planets of a star system, they are prime choices for raiders and pirates, leading to their designation as <i>pirate points</i>. These jump points exist where the gravitational attraction of all planetary objects cancels each other out and overall gravitation is reduced below the critical limit for hyperspace field formation.  While <i>pirate point</i> locations can be estimated by secondary school physics (generally, pirate points inside the proximity limit are congruent with the Lagrange Points, which exists due to the cancellation of gravity between two bodies), such jump points are difficult for JumpShips to utilize because they are much smaller than the standard jump points and have much more complicated motions. Rather than only following the star like the zenith and nadir points, the pirate points are subject to gravity of other moving objects in the star system.  This makes a navigator's job nightmarish when attempting to use a pirate point. Plotting the jump is impossible without computer aid, and can take hours with one. Missing the jump point is entirely possible, resulting in the JumpShip attempting to arrive in a region of space that is not a valid jump point.",
