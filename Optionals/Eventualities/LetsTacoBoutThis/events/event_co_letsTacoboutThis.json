Do you know how rare this stuff is to acquire?\"\r\n\r\nDr. Murad sits up, an interested look on her face, \"Please tell me that you know what to do with this stuff.  We do not need another MedBay incident.\"\r\n\r\n\"Shouldn't be a problem Doc.  Taco Truck franchises are all mobile, so their mince is designed to be moved about all the time.  As long as the galley has all the spices, we will be in Taco Heaven! \u2014 my team will take care of the goods.\" Yang flashes you a winning smile. \"In fact, I know someone who's family actually started Taco Truck.  If we can convice him to help in the galley, we'll have the best tacos you have ever tasted!  What do you say, Commander? You want some tacos on the menu?\"",
