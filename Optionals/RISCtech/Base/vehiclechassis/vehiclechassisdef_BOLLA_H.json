    "Details": "After the Word of Blake was defeated in the Jihad, Maxwell-Pulaski Motors modified the design slightly and produced it for the Republic of the Sphere in 3084.[9] The main differences are the removal of its Blakist features. The infantry bay was reduced to four tons, and the C3i system was replaced by a C3 slave unit. The machine gun ammunition was reduced to half a ton. All these changes increased the pod space available to the RAF Bollas by four and a half tons, but the turret can only mount fifteen tons of equipment. The Stealth Armor was retained, as was the Guardian ECM suite.\n\n<b><color=#ffcc00>Fusion: Expensive engine that works in a Vacuum.</color></b>\n\n<b><color=#ffcc00>Movement: 5/8 Hex: 150/240 Meters.</color></b>\n\n<color=#ffcc00><b>Armor:</b> Vehicle Stealth\n<b>Structure:</b> Structure\n<b>Values       A        S  </b>\n<b>Front</b>       200     30\n<b>Left</b>         160     30\n<b>Right</b>       160     30\n<b>Rear</b>        150     30\n<b>Turret</b>      210     30\n\n<b>Total</b>      880    150</color>\n\n<color=#ff0000>Quirk: Off Roader</color>\n\n<color=#ffcc00> Omni Vehicle</color>\n\n<color=#ffcc00> Can carry 1 Battle Armor Squads.</color>",
