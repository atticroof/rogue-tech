  "Intro": "With your contract already signed, you can't back out now, and the fine print has more teeth than you realized. Now you've got to act as a roving Sales Rep for the Quicsell corp, by way of using their products in a live mercenary company.",
  "BioDescription": "You're not entirely sure how a \"sales rep\" job turned into a \"walking demonstration\", but here you are. It's been several years now since you got swindled into peddling Quicsell products, but at least the \"aggressive sales pitches\" you're mandated to undergo are entertaining."
