Imagine the increased amount of fame I..*cough* we will achieve once it is known we can handle Epsilon-level contracts!\" <color=#A8A8A8>You shake your head at the almost-bouncing Darius, but decided to look into the matter later in the day.</color>\n\n\n<b><color=#35dde0>Information:</b> The access to Superheavy Mission contracts can now be unlocked.  These missions are <b>considerably</b> harder as they will include one or more Superheavy 'Mechs or vehicles, which each can weigh up to 200 tons, depending on your current difficulty rating.</color>",
