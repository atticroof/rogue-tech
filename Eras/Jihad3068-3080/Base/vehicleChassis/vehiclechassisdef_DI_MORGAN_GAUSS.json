The vehicle's engine is downgraded to a 200 XL Fusion, and its armor reduced by two and half tons. Named for Morgan Hasek-Davion, the DI Morgan was created as fire support vehicle as a replacement of the aging Schrek PPC carrier in House Steiner's armed forces. The vehicle was first created after the loss of many of the old Lyran standby during the onslaught of the Jihad. However, due to its expensive equipment, the vehicle had high price tag and few smaller commands can afford the vehicle. Defiance offered low-interest loans to allow the vehicle to be more affordable.\n\n<b><color=#ffcc00>Fusion: Expensive engine that works in a Vacuum.</color></b>\n\n<b><color=#ffcc00>Movement: 2/3 Hex: 60/90 Meters.</color></b>\n\n<color=#ffcc00><b>Armor:</b> Heavy Ferro\n<b>Structure:</b> Structure\n<b>Values       A        S  </b>\n<b>Front</b>       260     50\n<b>Left</b>         150     50\n<b>Right</b>       150     50\n<b>Rear</b>        105     50\n<b>Turret</b>      160     50\n\n<b>Total</b>      825    250</color>\n\n<color=#ff0000>Quirk: Advanced Optics</color>",
