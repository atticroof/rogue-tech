    "Details": "This redesigned variant removes all mounted weapons and replaces them with two Coventry Star Fire LRM-15 racks, each with their own Artemis IV fire control system and 2 tons of ammunition to provide even greater accuracy and firepower. To make room from the additional weapons the engine was downgraded to a Doorman 140 Fusion engine giving it a maximum speed of 64 km/h. The StarSlab/5.5 Standard armor was replaced with Star Slab/4 Ferro-Fibrous to save weight, but this also reduced its armor by a significant amount, making it a much easier target to destroy. The Hunter Light Support Tank is popular with planetary militias and second-line units. It was designed by Defiance Industries as a cheap, reliable and effective combat vehicle to provide covering fire support for combat units withdrawing from the front lines. \n\n<b><color=#ffcc00>Fusion: Expensive engine that works in a Vacuum.</color></b>\n\n<b><color=#ffcc00>Movement: 4/6 Hex: 120/180 Meters.</color></b>\n\n<color=#ffcc00><b>Armor:</b> Ferro-Fibrous\n<b>Structure:</b> Structure\n<b>Values       A        S  </b>\n<b>Front</b>       160     20\n<b>Left</b>         110     20\n<b>Right</b>       110     20\n<b>Rear</b>         90     20\n\n<b>Total</b>      470     80</color>\n\n<color=#ff0000>Quirk: Accurate Weapon - Missiles</color>",
