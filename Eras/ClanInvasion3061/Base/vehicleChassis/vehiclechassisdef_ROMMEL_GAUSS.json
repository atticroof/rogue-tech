    "Details": "This 3054 version of the Rommel replaces the standard weaponry with a Gauss Rifle, a pair of Medium Lasers, and a pair of Machine Guns in the turret. For additional anti-infantry capabilities, this version also mounts a pair of Machine Guns on the front of the tank and a single Machine Gun covers the rear. The only real weakness is that the design only provides a half ton of ammunition for all five Machine Guns. The Rommel tank is a 65-ton armored combat vehicle, specializing in close range fighting and urban combat. Identical to its twin, the Patton, in every way but armament and armor configuration, the Rommel has primarily served with the Lyran Commonwealth and the Lyran Alliance. It is named after Field Marshal Erwin Rommel, a legendary commander of armored and mechanized forces renowned for his exploits during World War II on Terra. The Rommel was designed concurrently with the Patton in the early 3000s, when Defiance Industries decided that an armored combat vehicle capable of replacing 'Mechs was needed. Since 'Mech production was nearly at a standstill, the ability to produce and field armored vehicles became a necessity for every Successor State. \n\n<b><color=#ffcc00>Fusion: Expensive engine that works in a Vacuum.</color></b>\n\n<b><color=#ffcc00>Movement: 4/6 Hex: 120/180 Meters.</color></b>\n\n<color=#ffcc00><b>Armor:</b> Ferro-Fibrous\n<b>Structure:</b> Structure\n<b>Values       A        S  </b>\n<b>Front</b>       235     35\n<b>Left</b>         200     35\n<b>Right</b>       200     35\n<b>Rear</b>        145     35\n<b>Turret</b>      220     35\n\n<b>Total</b>      1000    175</color>\n\n<color=#ff0000>Quirk: Main Battle Tank</color>",
