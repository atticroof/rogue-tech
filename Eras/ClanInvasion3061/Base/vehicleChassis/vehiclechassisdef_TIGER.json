    "Details": "Succeeding the massive, outdated Estevez as the Armed Forces of the Federated Suns main battle tank in the middle of the 25th century, the Tiger was designed to be lighter and faster than, yet still able to outgun, most of its rivals. After much testing, newcomers Veridian Dynamics of Torrence favored a conventional engine and a heavy autocannon to keep costs as low as possible. With its heavy engine and over a third of its total mass devoted to weapons, the Tiger's weak spot was the thin armor. Its six tons of standard armor were only a third of that of contemporaries such as the Marsden II, and barely enough to survive two heavy autocannon hits to the same location. \n\n<b><color=#ffcc00>ICE: Air breathing Combustion Engine.
