    "Details": "The original (and top-heavy) version did not succeed into getting from the prototype stages of its development. This lightly armored ICE powered version Shillelagh was armed with a single 15-tubed Long-Range Missile Launcher. The Shillelagh Missile Tank is an early thirty-second century Combat Vehicle which was first produced for the Draconis Combine. Originally designed and prototyped during the 2nd Succession War, the vehicle suffered from instability and other technical problems that proved to be insurmountable at the time. Shortly after the Second Combine-Dominion War, the DCMS was in need of an inexpensive replacement vehicle for its militia forces. For this reason, engineers at Buda Imperial Vehicles revived the Shillelagh. Redesigned with inexpensive thirty-second century technology, the tank entered production as part of the Combine's efforts to rebuild its frontline forces by swapping more effective combat vehicle designs taken from the militias and replacing them with vehicles like the Shillelagh. Despite it being redesigned, the vehicle still is haunted by lingering design flaws.\n\n<b><color=#ffcc00>ICE: Air breathing Combustion Engine.
