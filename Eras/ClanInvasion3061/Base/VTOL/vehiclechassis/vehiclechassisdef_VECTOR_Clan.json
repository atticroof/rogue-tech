    "Details": "A number of Vectors and their plans were taken on The Exodus. The Clans continued to use and improve the versatile VTOL over the centuries. This model forgoes a transport role to focus on skirmishing. The Star League Defense Force requested the next generation of combat support VTOL in 2708. It took more than two decades with hundreds of different people being involved and only finally getting realistic specifications laid out by Aleksandr Kerensky. It was finally awarded to General Motors who created a VTOL which could replace other VTOLs in their specific roles with one design which would simplify the replacement parts process. The design also incorporated a fusion engine to power the craft and the energy weapons which would eliminate the need for a fuel source and ammunition dependency.\n\n<b><color=#ffcc00>Fusion: Expensive engine that works in a Vacuum.</color></b>\n\n<b><color=#ffcc00>Movement: 12/18 Hex: 360/540 Meters.</color></b>\n\n<color=#ffcc00><b>Armor:</b> Ferro-Fibrous (C)\n<b>Structure:</b> Structure\n<b>Values       A        S  </b>\n<b>Front</b>       140     18\n<b>Left</b>         120     18\n<b>Right</b>       120     18\n<b>Rear</b>         80     18\n<b>Turret</b>       15     18\n\n<b>Total</b>      475     90</color>\n\n<color=#ff0000>Quirk: Missile Jammer</color>",
