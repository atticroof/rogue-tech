    "Details": "This Experimental prototype Tukogawa MBT began its development by Buda Imperial Vehicles on Luthien in 3067. The one-off vehicle was almost lost when Luthien fell into chaos with the dawn of the Jihad, and the supervising Technician, Roald Vu, was killed. During the recovery process in mid-3070s, the prototype was rediscovered. The DCMS decided to use this vehicle as testbed for new type of LRM launcher. The vehicle is fitted with a turreted mounted 15-tubed Extended Long Range Missile Launcher, with 2 tons of ammo. Co-axed with the launcher is a Class 10 Hyper-Velocity Autocannon with two tons of ammunition. To make room for these weapons, the vehicle's engine was changed out for a 280 Rated XXL Fusion Engine. The new engine propelled the vehicle up to 80 km/h. To protect the fragile engine, the hull was given 8.5 tons worth of Clan Ferro Fibrous Armor. A C3 Slave Computer is fitted to allow lancemates to coordinate fire against enemy forces. \n\n<b><color=#ffcc00>Fusion: Expensive engine that works in a Vacuum.</color></b>\n\n<b><color=#ffcc00>Movement: 5/8 Hex: 150/240 Meters.</color></b>\n\n<color=#ffcc00><b>Armor:</b> Ferro-Fibrous (C)\n<b>Structure:</b> Structure\n<b>Values       A        S  </b>\n<b>Front</b>       280     30\n<b>Left</b>         195     30\n<b>Right</b>       195     30\n<b>Rear</b>        165     30\n<b>Turret</b>      220     30\n\n<b>Total</b>      1055    150</color>\n\n<color=#ff0000>Quirk: Enhanced FPE</color>",
