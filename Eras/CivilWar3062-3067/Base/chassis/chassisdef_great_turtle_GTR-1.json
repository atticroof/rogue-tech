    "Details": "With its focus on defense, the 'Mech is armed with very few weapons for an Assault. The GTR-1's main armament is its Large X-Pulse Laser, which is backed up by three Medium X-Pulse Lasers, all of which are linked to a Targeting Computer. To provide additional mobility, the Great Turtle is equipped with three torso-mounted Jump Jets. These allow the Great Turtle to get out of sticky situations relatively quickly.\n\n<b><color=#e62e00>Quirk: Quad Mech</color></b>\n\n<b><color=#e62e00>Drop Cost Multiplier: 1.18</color></b>",

  "YangsThoughts": "The Great Turtle was designed as an experiment in MechWarrior safety. With the recovery of the Helm Memory Core, weapons technology had advanced more in the twenty years between the Fourth Succession War and the Clan Invasion than it had in the previous three hundred years. One effect of these advances in weapons was the dramatic reduction in a MechWarrior's life expectancy. Many weapons could destroy a 'Mech's head, engine, or gyro with one shot, leaving the MechWarrior dead or wounded. VEST took the concept of MechWarrior protection to an extreme. The Great Turtle uses a quad chassis to hold the maximum amount of armor possible. The Great Turtle's armor weighs 40 tons, as much as a Clint BattleMech. For more protection the VEST engineers used experimental Hardened Armor that effectively provides twice as much protection as standard armor. This means that the Great Turtle can take staggering amounts of damage without worrying the pilot. Enemies who target the 'Mech's head looking for a clean kill will be disappointed. The Hardened armor can withstand a Gauss rifle hit, but more importantly, the Great Turtle uses a Torso Mounted Cockpit to provide extra protection for the pilot. Using a standard engine reduces the possibility of an engine explosion, and a compact gyro further increases longevity.",
