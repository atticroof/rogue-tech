    "Details": "Using some of the newest technology available in the Federated Suns, the 9NAIS was built in 3067 by NAIS on an Endo Steel structure and utilizes an XL engine for power, giving it a ground speed of 86.4 km/h. The 'Mech is armored with twelve tons of armor for protection and has an entirely updated weapons payload. The primary weapon is a RAC/5 which can fire at six times the normal rate of fire. Supporting it are three ER medium lasers and a Streak SRM-6. The lasers and rotary autocannon are linked to an advanced Targeting Computer. Finally, for added protection against enemy electronics, the 'Mech has a Guardian ECM suite.\n\n<b><color=#e62e00>Quirk: Multi Trac</color></b>\n\n<b><color=#e62e00>Drop Cost Multiplier: 1.09</color></b>",

  "YangsThoughts": "The Thunderbolt started production in 2491 as a planetary-assault 'Mech, and in fact was one of the heaviest 'Mechs that could be produced at that time. Since then the 'Mech, known affectionately as the T-Bolt, has had its classification changed as larger 'Mechs were built but thanks to periodic updates it is still feared and respected by many. With its varied arsenal, the Thunderbolt remains one of the best-armed 'Mechs, making it capable of serving in many roles. It is also an incredibly well-armored 'Mech, rivaling or exceeding the amount of armor carried by some assault 'Mechs. One downside to the Thunderbolt though is poor heat management.",
