    "Details": "The 4L was a variant built for the Capellan Confederation by Ceres Metals starting in 3066. The design used a Taurian-produced standard engine for power and was built around a Endo Steel skeleton. The 'Mech carried an ER large laser in its right forearm as its primary weapon, joined by two ER medium lasers in the left and right arm for secondary weapons. It also mounted a machine gun in either arm, with half a ton of reloads carried in the center torso. The six jump jets split between the rear side torsos were also upgraded from the original, being specially designed to protect the exhaust ports and improve cooling during operation. One of the more radical changes was the use of eight tons of Ceres Metals Stealth Armor, making the Phoenix Hawk harder to target at range.\n\n<b><color=#e62e00>Quirk: Improved Communications</color></b>\n\n<b><color=#e62e00>Drop Cost Multiplier: 1.03</color></b>",

  "YangsThoughts": "First introduced by the Terran Hegemony in 2568, the Phoenix Hawk was one of the most famous BattleMechs in the Inner Sphere. The 'Mech began life when Orguss Industries realized that it could reinforce the Stinger chassis to create a larger version, one with the same speed and maneuverability as the Stinger but with superior armor, firepower, and electronics. Originally a staple of the SLDF, Phoenix Hawks remained common within the armies of the Successor States after the fall of the Star League. At first Phoenix Hawks were grouped together to form powerful recon lances, but as they started reaching their various deployments, their full potential as command 'Mechs was discovered and many were reassigned to instead lead units of smaller recon 'Mechs.",
