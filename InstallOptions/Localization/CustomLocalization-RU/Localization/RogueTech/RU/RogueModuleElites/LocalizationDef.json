      "content": "Peter Chang was born on Old Kentucky, in the Capellan Confederation, to an established family of skilled metalworkers. He preferred books to metallurgy and his supportive family encouraged him to work hard and attend a local vocational school after his militia training. When he graduated at the top of his class and was accepted into Sian University, they couldn't have been prouder.\n\nThey were less pleased when they realized he intended to study literature and philosophy rather than something useful, but Peter didn't care. Having achieved a place in academia, he fully intended to stay there. He underestimated the viciousness of the tenure track, though. Soon, via maneuverings only sketchily recorded, he was strongly encouraged to travel, and travel far.\n\nRelying on a small stipend provided in exchange for his silence, he explored the Inner Sphere and discovered that adventure was more to his taste than academia anyhow. On one journey, he found himself piloting a Marauder — and found that he was good at it. When he received word that his benefactor had died and his stipend would no longer be provided, he knew exactly what to do next: mercenary work, out in the Periphery.\n\nHe's something of a curiosity among MechWarriors, with his academic background and extensive civilian travels.

While he shared his family's love for explosions, he quickly became bored with the limited creativity of the circus's well-defined show. As soon as he could talk his family into it, he and two of his cousins were traded to a new circus looking to start up its own pyrotechnics show in exchange for an apprentice dancer. The new circus focused on dramatic reenactments of historical battles—complete with BattleMech shells that required his expertise to look and sound real.\r\n\r\nBarely two years after joining his new circus, he started knocking at the doors of the Magistracy Armed Forces, hoping to join the Magistracy Royal Guard as a MechWarrior. Since his education up until that point had been very spotty, he was repeatedly turned away in favor of more traditional candidates. But the young Coldfire knew nothing could be better than piloting a 'Mech into battle, so he buckled down and learned just enough to pass the entry exams imposed by the MAF. They gave him the training he wanted, but not the battles. As soon as his contract expired, he abandoned the peace-loving Magistracy for a place where a MechWarrior could always find work: the unclaimed, lawless systems of the Rimward Periphery.\r\n\r\nAs a pilot, Coldfire is loud, jovial, and always up for the highest-risk missions—even if the likelihood of getting paid is low. Helping others is in his blood, he claims, and if he can have a good time while doing it, even better! He loves pushing the biggest 'Mechs to their highest speeds and relishes a well-executed Death From Above. Outside of battle, he's rambunctious but usually stops short of causing real trouble to his COs. And if you ever need a pyrotechnics display, he's your man.",

Before he was ten, he was camping alone in the wilderness near his small town, and taking apart household appliances to see how they worked. Yes, he got lost; yes, sometimes the appliances never worked again. The important thing was that now he knew.\r\n\r\nIn secondary school, he wondered what would happen if he started an AgroMech racing league. He found out (and was suspended). He wondered what would happen if he provoked others who quailed at challenges. He found out (and came in third instead of first). After he graduated, having thoroughly explored his small town and the local spaceport, he headed to Circinus.

      "content": "The Steiner-affiliated mercenary unit that raised Aaron Morrow told him his parents had died heroes. It wasn't until he was older that he learned they wouldn't have had to die heroes if House Steiner had sent the reinforcements they'd promised. It was at the same time he learned about the elaborate, long-term revenge ploy his commander had been pursuing.\n\nYoung Aaron had already been on half a dozen missions at this point. He was involved romantically with a LCAF regular. When he learned that the Steiner had betrayed his unit and his family, and that in return, years later, his unit was about to betray House Steiner — well, some young men might have chosen revenge. Others might have chosen love. Aaron Morrow, torn between his heart and his history, chose neither. He warned his lover what was planned, explained why, and walked away.\n\nIn the Periphery, he continues performing the only trade he knows.

      "content": "Jason Castro is the firstborn son of the Duke of Rio in the Draconis March of the Federated Suns, and as such he received all the best training available, and was taught to know his own value. He was one of the first graduates from the newly rebuilt Robinson Battle Academy, and was assigned a position of responsibility early.\n\nUnfortunately, despite his lineage, his training and his confidence, he lacked the wisdom to lead his command well. Too soon after receiving his commission, he bungled an attack on a superior Draconis Combine force along the border. His entire unit was wiped out, and he barely escaped with his life.\n\nHorrified, his father pulled strings to have him sent home to relative safety.

He did not, of course, make a name for himself, because his work was never signed, but even after he was injured and transferred back home again, some of his cartoons were used as an unofficial currency among the members of the Analysis Branch.\n\nHe remained on his home planet until it was attacked and annexed by the Capellan Confederation. After escaping the invasion with his family and seeing them resettled elsewhere in the Duchy, he made his way to Galatea to earn a living as a mercenary. He still draws his cartoons, still never signs them, but the junior pilots and crew who receive one after a blunder know exactly who they come from and, if they're smart, they treasure them\n\n<b><color=#00ffff>Может управлять мехами и техникой.</color></b>",

      "original": "Risenki Ariamaki was born on a merchant ship in the Outworld Alliance, to an extended family of tinkers and traders that spent far more time traveling between systems than planet-side. He grew up learning almost all of the trades associated with spacefaring merchants, but was far better working with his hands than bartering with customers.\r\n\r\nFor many years, he felt he had nothing to complain of as one of the younger members of a very large family. However, as the oldest generation began passing away, Risenki found himself being drawn into the more complicated squabbles of the new generation of leaders. He hadn't minded obeying the dictates of his grandparents and great-aunts.

He even attended the Robinson Battle Academy, where his loyalty to House Davion was complemented by indoctrination with the hatred for the Draconis Combine so common in Robinson graduates. But he was never able to graduate from Robinson Battle Academy. During a live fire examination conducted though a punitive raid on Delacruz, Michael was deep behind enemy lines on a reconnaissance mission when recall orders came in from central command. So far from the landing zone and unable to arrive safely before liftoff, he was abandoned and left for dead. Fleeing deep into the forested wilderness, he left his assigned mech, a battered old SDR-5V Spider, under a makeshift shelter. He adopted a local name to help to hide his identity, and masqueraded as a member of the unproductive class until he could secure transport off-world. \r\n\r\nAt first, he expected all the horror stories fed to him about the Combine to be the truth, but quickly learned that not only had much of what he'd been taught had been a gross vilification, but numerous atrocities that pushed the boundaries of the Ares Conventions that his own forces had committed were never spoken of. He also began to suspect that he was intentionally abandoned on world by his COs for being of civilian blood. Selling his services as an unlicensed mercenary to the Delacruz yakuza oyabun, and eventually to other private concerns, he quickly gained a reputation for skill in reconnaissance and guerrilla campaigns.

When Davion invaded her homeworld, the 23 year old Alicia found herself pushed into the frontline as a member of a resistance cell defying the Federated Suns occupation of the world. Here Alicia found herself rising though the ranks until she was the leader of the most active cell on the world. While estimates vary, most historians place her activities as claiming 1500 - 2900 lives of Davion occupation forces.\n\nAfter a particular gruesome attack on a Davion regional headquarters, FedSuns troops had had enough and began retaliatory strikes against the population. Fearing for the lives of her loved ones, Alicia used her contacts in the Maskirovka to arrange them to be smuggled off world so that she could continue her campaign against the FedSuns occupiers. Unfortunately for Alicia, one of the citizens killed by the Davion retaliation was a distant relative of the Chancellor himself. As such the Maskirovka decided to avenge the Chancellor and to deal with a citizen they viewed as becoming too popular and so they betrayed Alicia, shooting down the dropship carrying everyone Alicia had ever truly cared for and selling out the location of her cell's headquarters to a local Davion commander.\n\nDavion jumped at the chance to deal with this thorn in their side once and for all and mercilessly bombed the entire village that housed her headquarters. Badly wounded, Alicia somehow survived the attack, dragging her ruined body several miles before collapsing near a remote and secret Comstar listening post. Found by a patrol, Alicia was smuggled off world, with the local Comstar Demi-Precentor seeing her potential as an operative for them. Despite the scars now covering her body, Alicia would fully recover thanks to cybernetic implants that were surgically embedded in her.\n\nFilled with hatred for all the successor lords, it was of little surprise that Alicia, now going by the code name \"Lady Alekto\", sided with the Word of Blake when the schism within Comstar occured. When the Jihad broke out, Alekto soon made a terrifying name for herself. Unafraid to order even the largest scale war-crimes imaginable, Alekto brilliantly masterminded numerous devastating strikes against the successor lords over the years of the brutal war. In addition it was found that she had a knack for designing battlemech loadouts, that while appearing odd, turned out to be highly effective and virtual nightmares to face. Her personal 'Firebird' was so completely devestating it was said to be able to ignite entire forests and overheat lances in a single pass.\n\nAlekto's fate remains unknown as she vanished in the chaos that was the aftermath of the Jihad.

Initially Cargo learned the family trade as a run of the mill vehicle mechanic, however it became quickly that Cargo was meant for more as he showed a knack for not just fixing vehicles, but improving upon them.\n\nBy his 21st birthday, Cargo found himself drafted into the Alliance Borderers as a tank mechanic. Here Cargo quickly rose through the ranks of the unit's engineering corps, proving not only hard working but able to diagnose and and fix issues that even mechanics with 30 years more experience with those models could not. \n\nBy his 25th birthday, Cargo found himself the head mechanic on a detachment of the Borderers stationed on Cerberus when fate struck in the form of a deep raid by DCMS troops. As Kuritan forces struck the base Cargo was stationed at, they scattered the battalion defenders and began tearing through the hangers destroying vehicle after vehicle. Provoked into rage by watching days of his hard work going up into smoke, it is said Cargo grabbed the nearest few fellow mechanics by their shirts and shoved them in the closest tank to them. Taking the lead, Cargo then proceeded to lead the completely green crew in fierce defensive action. Cargo and his makeshift crew not only held out while crucial reinforcements arrived, but also succeeded in crippling 2 mechs and outright destroying one. For his quick thinking and heroic efforts, Cargo was awarded some of the nation's most prestigious military service awards. When offered monetary awards Cargo turned them down, instead requesting that he be allowed to bring his beloved pet ferret with him to work, a request a rather stunned high command accepted.\n\nFor the next decade Cargo served in the duel roles as both the head mechanic of the Borderers and as a tank commander in its command company before largely retiring from front-line service. This was at the behest of the Alliance high command, who had come to value his ever increasing skill at designing vehicle variants that were both cheap to produce and extremely cost effective.\n\nNow heading a design bureau, Cargo has become one of these most despised people alive to many mechwarriors. So terrifying are the designs he has produced that many a mechwarrior has called them \"bullshit\" or decried that mechs are supposed to be the kings of the battlefield, not tanks. Perhaps it is not surprising then that when Cargo makes trips to the field for studies, he does so primarily amongst other tank crews.\n",

      "original": "As the Star League reached its pinnacle of its technological advancements, it became apparent that the artificial intelligence entrusted to help run the bloated bureaucracy was being outclassed and showing its age.\n\nAfter a number of attempted upgrades failed to improve RogueBot, the Star League initiated project Echo. The goal of the project was the creation of a next generation AI. While slow going, the project incorporated a number of unique innovations. Built on a modular and flexible design, in contrast to its predecessor the new AI proved to much more capable than the original. After several more years of development the new AI, now dubbed RogueBot II was deemed ready to enter service with the Star League.\n\nRogueBot II's initial deployment was not as smooth as many had hoped, but it none the less quickly took over the original RogueBot's responsibilities within the Star League and the original was slated for decommissioning. RogueBot II's more modular design allowed for continuous improvements to be made to the AI at a relatively rapid rate and it found itself pressed into an ever growing number of roles within the government, primarily as a cost saving measure.\n\nLike with the original RogueBot, the SLDF attempted to press the AI into military service, seeing drone combatants as the future. After some work the AI proved a quick study with ground combat forces and the army began reaching out to contractors to help design new battlemechs and ground vehicles for mass deployment as drones. Naval combat proved trickier but slow progress was being made.\n\nUltimately, these plans were put to an end with the Amaris coupe. While Amaris attempted to co-opt RogueBot, he found he was unable and the AI swiftly relocated its core servers to an unknown location and remained a persistant thorn in the usurper's side for the duration of his rule.\n\nAfter the war finished, RogueBot evidently decided that the Star League was dead and refused all efforts to be brought back under the control of the Star League or any of its member states. Every now and again some of the rare or prototype drone units the AI once commanded have been spotted raiding or defending various places throughout the Inner-Sphere or periphery. What the purpose of these deployments is remains unknown, although it seems the AI has remained in occasional contact with the clans over the centuries, even as the successor lords remained unaware of their existence, notably having a strange relationship with the Star Adder Khan, Bearing. Some strange rumors even persist linking the fabled \"Mr. Bubbles\" to the rogue AI, with more than a few hinting it as having become her pet.\n",

If my calculations are correct, this thing can push over just over 140 km/h while both the MASC and supercharger are active. Just ... well, remember to turn them off once in a while, ya hear?",
