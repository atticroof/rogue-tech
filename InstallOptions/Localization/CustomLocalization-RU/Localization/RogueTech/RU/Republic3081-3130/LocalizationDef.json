Developed by the Lyran Commonwealth and elements of the former Free Worlds League the Ghost carries an extensive array of electronic warfare equipment into combat. A Beagle Active Probe allows the Ghost to find enemy units, while Stealth Armor and a Guardian ECM Suite allows the 'Mech to live up to its name. With excellent land speed and formidable medium-range weaponry, the Ghost is ideal for hunter-killer and heavy raiding missions, especially when paired with Griffins. This variant developed in 3087 replaces the standard weapons with a pair of Large Pulse Lasers, an ER Small Laser, and a single SRM-6. Built around an Endo Steel skeleton, this version uses a Defiance 300 Light Fusion Engine and standard armor with CASE to protect itself.",

Модернизированная броня ценится воинами, которые пилотировали старый Stinger, но эта броня все еще слишком легкая, чтобы позволить меху принимать участие в прямых столкновениях. Double Heat Sink неплохо справляются с охлаждением Stinger IIC. Вариант IIC-2 отличается от IIC-1 улучшенными системами слежения за целью и системами электронного противодействия, но установка этих систем несколько ухудшила его скорость и маневренность.

The crew is protected by six tons of standard plate armor. The primary weapon of the Hadur is the Class 16 Arrow IV launcher. This massive weapon provides missile artillery support to friendly forces. However, unlike the Naga OmniMech, the Hadur has a single twenty round magazine instead of four smaller five round magazines. This means that switching ammunition types is a problem for Hadur crews.

Eleven tons of armor, a modest increase of half a ton, provided average protection for the vehicle's weight.\n\n<b><color=#ffcc00>Термоядерный: дорогой двигатель, работающий в вакууме.</color></b>\n\n<b><color=#ffcc00>Передвижение: 4/6 Hex: 120/180 Meters.</color></b>\n\n<color=#ffcc00><b>Броня:</b> Vehicle Stealth Броня\n<b>Структура:</b> Структура\n<b>Значения Б С </b>\n<b>Перед</b> 235 30\n<b>Лево</b> 175 30\n<b>Право</b> 175 30\n<b> Зад</b> 140 30\n<b>Turret</b> 180 30\n\n<b>Итого</b> 905 150</color>\n\n<color=#ff0000>Особенность: Основной боевой танк</color>",

It is named after Field Marshal Erwin Rommel, a legendary commander of armored and mechanized forces renowned for his exploits during World War II on Terra. The Rommel was designed concurrently with the Patton in the early 3000s, when Defiance Industries decided that an armored combat vehicle capable of replacing 'Mechs was needed. Since 'Mech production was nearly at a standstill, the ability to produce and field armored vehicles became a necessity for every Successor State.\n\n<b><color=#ffcc00>Термоядерный: дорогой двигатель, работающий в вакууме.</color></b>\n\n<b><color=#ffcc00>Передвижение: 3/5 Hex: 90/150 Meters.</color></b>\n\n<color=#ffcc00><b>Броня:</b> Heavy Ferro-Fibrous\n<b>Структура:</b> Structure\n<b>Значения Б С </b>\n<b>Перед</b> 300 35\n<b>Лево</b> 195 35\n<b>Право</b> 195 35\n<b> Зад</b> 165 35\n<b>Turret</b> 240 35\n\n<b>Итого</b> 1095 175</color>\n\n<color=#ff0000>Особенность: Основной боевой танк</color>",

The crew is protected by six tons of standard plate armor. The primary weapon of the Hadur is the Class 16 Arrow IV launcher. This massive weapon provides missile artillery support to friendly forces.

Instead of using expensive BattleMechs for recon, this armored scout allows a Falcon commander to find an opponent and direct heavier units into combat. With a top speed of 162 km/h, the Nacon can quickly find an enemy force and disengage. Protection comes from five tons of ferro-fibrous armor, which provides enough protection for quick escapes. However, the rear armor can only withstand a single PPC hit while the front face can withstand more than four PPC hits.

Due to it being larger than any scout car, it can act as a mobile communication outpost. With its advanced sensor suite which is tied to both its communication and targeting systems, it can navigate with only its sensors. While hot environments would normally wreak havoc upon its advanced electronics, the heat sinks from its Medium Laser cool the sensors while the laser is not in use. This allows it to operate in even the hottest environments where other scout vehicles cannot.

Substantial armor of at least six tons and various mid and long range weapon packages keep the Condor relevant. A heavy cavalry unit designed for rapid reaction to a shifting battle, the Condor was one of the few heavy hover tanks available at the time of it's introduction. This immense hovercraft is capable of a flank speed of 129 km/h and a cruising speed of 86 km/h, making it one of the fastest vehicles in its weight class. \n\n<b><color=#ffcc00>Топливная ячейка: улучшенный двигатель, работающий в вакууме.</color></b>\n\n<b><color=#ffcc00>Передвижение: 8/12 Hex: 240/360 Meters.</color></b>\n\n<color=#ffcc00><b>Броня:</b> Reflective Coating\n<b>Структура:</b> Structure\n<b>Значения Б С </b>\n<b>Перед</b> 150 25\n<b>Лево</b> 100 25\n<b>Право</b> 100 25\n<b> Зад</b> 85 25\n<b>Turret</b> 110 25\n\n<b>Итого</b> 545 125</color>\n\n<color=#ff0000>Особенность: Быстрый уход с линии</color>",

      "content": "The original variant of the Tarantula is armored with four and a half tons of armor, while it only carries about three quarters of the theoretical maximum armor, the 'Mech's amazing speed makes the Tarantula capable of avoiding most damage. As the design is focused on scouting, the Tarantula carries a light armament that is common to a 'Mech of its size and role. The primary weapons are a pair of medium lasers which give the Tarantula most of its striking power.

      "original": "The Patton tank is a 65-ton armored combat vehicle, specializing in conventional armored warfare. Identical to its twin, the Rommel, in every way but armament and armor configuration, the Patton has primarily served with the Lyran Commonwealth and the Lyran Alliance. It is named after General George S. Patton, Jr., a legendary commander of armored and mechanized forces renowned for his exploits during World War II on Terra. Unlike the Rommel, which features a massive and powerful but short-ranged AC/20 as its main gun, the Patton mounts an AC/10, giving it twice the ammunition capacity and superior firing range while also enabling it to be fitted with more armor.

Originally a Wolfs Dragoons exclusive Mech, it wasn’t until after the 4th War of Succession in 3030 that the Mech would spread beyond the Dragoons. Powered by a 300 rated Light Engine, the Marauder II MAD-6S is armed with a Gauss Rifle, paired ER PPC’s and Medium Pulse Lasers. AMS and an ER Small Laser round out the design. \n\n<b><color=#e62e00>Особенность: Узкий/низкий профиль</color></b>\n\n<b><color=#e62e00>Множитель стоимости высадки: 1.18</color></b>\n\n<br><br><color=#FFEF00>Лимит приводов рук: Left Lower, Right Lower</color>",

Unwilling to gamble on reverse-engineered Clan weaponry, the -9M replaces the prior pulse laser loadouts with variable speed medium lasers. While Nimakachi touts the -9M's 'greatly increased' short-range firepower as the basis for its high sales, customers indicate that demand for the model is only due to the desperation of the mid-thirty-second century. Industry watchers have been critical partly due to the absence of the promised ejection seat, but primarily because the -9M's weaponry doubles in mass for no significant increase in range. The new Spider could be outperformed by units with lighter weapon arrays.\n\n<b><color=#e62e00>Особенность: Шустрый</color></b>\n\n<b><color=#e62e00>Множитель стоимости высадки: 0.99</color></b>",

Built at the request of Lyran Commonwealth Armed Forces commanders for a new light-assault 'Mech, the Zeus is fast enough to keep up with most heavy 'Mechs, and is equally capable of defeating them. An evolution of the Zeus -9T, the new ZEU-11S is a mixture of technologies that blurs the Inner Sphere and Clan divide. Using Clan specification extended-range lasers, an extralight engine and LRM-15 launcher built on-site, the -11S seamlessly integrates these onto the frame of the -9T, although mating the Sphere-made Artemis FCS onto the ClanTech launcher did prove to be a challenge.
