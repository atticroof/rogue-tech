The crew is protected by six tons of standard plate armor. The primary weapon of the Hadur is the Class 16 Arrow IV launcher. This massive weapon provides missile artillery support to friendly forces. However, unlike the Naga OmniMech, the Hadur has a single twenty round magazine instead of four smaller five round magazines. This means that switching ammunition types is a problem for Hadur crews.

      "content": "[Society Version] The Hadur Fast Support Vehicle was developed by Clan Hell's Horses and introduced in 3102. Capable of reaching a top speed of 151 km/h, the Hadur can quickly position itself to provide heavy missile artillery support. It performs best when paired with forward scouts like the Asshur scout. The crew is protected by six tons of standard plate armor. The primary weapon of the Hadur is the Class 16 Arrow IV launcher.

      "original": "The Snub-Nose PPC is to a Particle Projector Cannon as a sawed-off shotgun is to a shotgun. This version of the PPC is slightly lighter than a standard PPC, but its energy discharge trails off considerably faster, leading to shorter range and reduced damage capacity over range. Despite almost no Snub-Nose PPCs surviving the Exodus, Society scientists saw enough potential to apply more modern PPC technology to the orginal design, leading to a higher damage capacity and less damage drop-off out to long ranges.",
