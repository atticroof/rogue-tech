The arm-mounted sensor arrays were shifted to fixed points around the torso and included new side-scanning, Doppler and triangulation sensors to maintain the same data-gathering capability. Additionally a new high-speed computer, capable of handling terabytes of data in seconds, meant the Ostscout no longer had to slow down when using its sensors. The targeting-tracking system was also replaced with a TRSS Eagle Eye system mated to a Beagle Active Probe, Guardian ECM, and head-mounted TAG, while the comm system was upgraded to the Exeter Longscan 300 w/C3i Computer for better fire mission coordination. For self-defense, the 9CS model carries two ER Medium Lasers in either arm and an ER Small Laser in its center torso.

Uziel несет автопушку LB-2X для атак типа «бей и беги», которая поддерживается большим импульсным лазером на расстоянии и множеством лазеров ER и SRM-6 для атаки с близкого расстояния. Подкрепленный приличной скоростью и реактивными двигателями для маневренности, Uziel не открывает ничего нового, но, тем не менее, это добротная и эффективная конструкция.\n\n<b><color=#e62e00>Особенность: Капюшон</color></b>\n\n<b><color=#e62e00>Множитель стоимости высадки: 1.04</color></b>\n\n<br><br><color=#FFEF00>Лимит приводов рук: Left Lower, Right Lower</color>",

The company, known for its wheeled vehicles, built the Turhan to answer the HAF's need for an urban assault vehicle to support its infantry in urban environments. The vehicle acted as an Armored Personnel Carrier, deploying troops from its large infantry transport bay. The vehicle is protected by seven and a half tons of Ferro-Fibrous armor, which ensured its cargo arrived at the designation intact. The Turhan's principal weaponry was its twin Large Lasers which were mounted in its turret. Mounted with the lasers were a pair of Machine Guns.\n\n <b><color=#ffcc00>Wheeled: Fast in open ground, slow in rough terrain.</color></b>\n\n <b><color=#ffcc00>Fusion: Expensive engine that works in a Vacuum.</color></b>\n\n <b><color=#ffcc00>Movement: 5/8 Hex: 150/240 Meters.</color></b>\n\n<b>Armor:</b> Armor\n<b>Structure:</b> Structure\n<b>Values       A        S  </b>\n<b>Front</b>       247     25\n<b>Left</b>         140     25\n<b>Right</b>       140     25\n<b>Rear</b>         90     25\n<b>Turret</b>      155     25\n\n<b>Total</b>      772    125\n",

For anti-infantry work, the Patton Ultra has three Machine Guns: One covers the rear while the other two cover the front of the tank. The Patton tank is a 65-ton armored combat vehicle, specializing in conventional armored warfare. Identical to its twin, the Rommel, in every way but armament and armor configuration, the Patton has primarily served with the Lyran Commonwealth and the Lyran Alliance. It is named after General George S. Patton, Jr., a legendary commander of armored and mechanized forces renowned for his exploits during World War II on Terra.

While it shares many of the parts and features of the design that inspired it, the Zhukov is smaller, better armored, and packs less weaponry than its predecessor. Its first major deployment was with the Wolf's Dragoons whereupon the Zhukov has since seen constant improvements and tweaks as suggested to Aldis Industries by the field units that use it.

This improves it's performance in open terrain allows it to take on some fire support roles. However as always HVAC are temperamental. In 3030, Aldis Industries deployed the successful follow up to its venerable Demolisher design, the slightly lighter Zhukov. While it shares many of the parts and features of the design that inspired it, the Zhukov is smaller, better armored, and packs less weaponry than its predecessor. Its first major deployment was with the Wolf's Dragoons whereupon the Zhukov has since seen constant improvements and tweaks as suggested to Aldis Industries by the field units that use it. The Zhukov's strength is its relative simplicity. Two turret mounted SarLon MaxiCannon Autocannon/10s are more than adequate at providing sufficient firepower for the discriminating buyer while imitating its larger cousin the Demolisher.\n\n<b><color=#ffcc00>ДВС: двигатель внутреннего сгорания.

Introduced in 3067 by Earthwerks for the Word of Blake Militia, this variant was armed with two Delta Dart LRM-15 launchers linked to Artemis IV fire control systems in either side torso and an Diverse Optics Sunbeam ER Large Laser in the center torso for long-range combat. It also mounted three Diverse Optics Sunfire ER Medium Lasers for short ranged support, one in each arm and the third in its head. This made the 8M effective at all ranges and gave it both long-range direct and indirect capabilities. The 8M was protected by thirteen and a half tons of Maximilian 100 standard armor which was better slopped in order to deflect weapons fire more easily. It carried twelve double heat sinks, and had a similar speed profile to the original Archer.

The N3 offers several new internal features, starting with its 280 extra light fusion engine and seven jump jets. The combination of an XL engine and an Endo Steel chassis permits the new design to carry eight and a half tons of Armor. The weaponry is equally impressive, the Vulcan II is equipped with 4 Small Pulse Lasers and 3 Medium Pulse Lasers. Finally, the techs installed eleven double heat sinks, enough to allow a Vulcan II pilot to run and fire all his weapons without overheating. However, jumping poses a problem for careless MechWarriors, and can quickly disable those who ignore the heat meter during a battle.\n\n<b><color=#e62e00>Особенность: Узкий/низкий профиль</color></b>\n\n<b><color=#e62e00>Множитель стоимости высадки: 1.02</color></b>",
