    "Details": "Born on Terra to an influential family, Ouranos grew up in a privileged environment and luxury almost unheard of since the fall of the Star League. However, unlike most of his peers, Ouranos did not let this fortune go to his head and instead filled him with an urge to improve the lives of those less fortunate than himself.\n\nEnrolled in the best academies that money and prestige could buy, and a natural affinity for technology it is of little surprise that Ouranos became one of the most knowledgeable in the workings of LosTech, surpassing even many vaunted Star League era scientists and researchers in a time when such knowledge was unheard of. With such a pedigree, Ouranos naturally found himself a position in ComStar.\n\nWhat was surprising, was Ouranos's forsaking of cushy desk jobs and research positions, instead opting to become a member of the ComGuard. Here he put his knowledge to the test, and was seemingly able to master nearly any 'Mech he piloted with ease.\n\nWith innumerable battles and covert operations under his belt, Ouranos proved time after time the most capable of the active ComGuard members and found himself deployed to all corners of the Sphere and near-Periphery. \n\nDriven by his inner-fire to bring civility back to the war-torn Sphere, Ouranos proved the natural choice to replace then Precentor-Martial Lan Leonhart upon his promotion to Primus, a deadly duo that any opponent dreaded to go up against.\n\nWhile never destined to become Primus himself, Ouranos contributed greatly to ComStar's golden age, helping to develop new technologies and pushing for the expansion of the Explorer Corp.",
