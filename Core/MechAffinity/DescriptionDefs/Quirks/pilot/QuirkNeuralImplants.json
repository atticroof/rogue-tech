  "Name" : "Pilot Quirk: Neural Implants",
  "Details" : "Pilots with neural implants are able to interface more directly with their 'Mech. Implants are required to gain the benefits of an active Enhanced Imaging or DNI-style cockpit, although the passive benefits of those cockpits will still apply to pilots without them. Cockpit Interface cockpits, however, require a pilot to possess neural implants to use at all.",
