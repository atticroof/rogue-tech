### Map Updates - *The Times They Are a-Changin'*

Galaxy At War (aka old offline Mode) has been removed.

Offline Mode/WarTech IIC now supports a selectable starting map era:

- 3040's Map: This is the classic RT map you know and love. All standard factions are available
- 3080's Map: This is map based on the canonical state of the Inner Sphere circa 3081 - 3085. New canon factions for this era have been added and a number of dead factions have been removed.

*Note: Once you have chosen a map year, you must commit to it, changing map era's mid career is not supported*
*Note 2: Map Year Selection is not available for Online Map Players*

### Kill Teams (Optional) - *You asked for harder content, here it is...*
**Kill Teams** is a new feature in Roguetech to increase late game difficulty and attempt to make the Mod more challenging for those that so desire. The feature enables lances of optimized (non-canon) 'Mechs and Vehicles with elite pilots that might drop as support for the enemy. These 'Mechs have been customized by our team to be as deadly as possible. Attempts to balance the difficulty for these units have been made, but this will be an ongoing process.

If **Kill Teams** are enabled, normal contracts will have a limit of *one* Support Lance per mission.
Since this means a reduction of amount of standard support lance dropped in a mission on average for contracts between *Difficulty 1* (half Green Skull) and *Difficulty 12* (one Orange Skull), the chance for a single standard support lance drop has been increased.
However, beginning with contracts at *Difficulty 13* (1.5 Orange Skulls) and up, support lance pilots and 'Mechs start being substituted by Kill Teams variants.  Kill Teams units are *REQUIRED* objectives in several mission types. Most Kill Teams units are unable to be salvaged, but any used equipment or weapons usually can be. 
*Note: Currently two Kill Teams units can be salvaged, good luck finding these (and surviving the encounter).*

Since we don't want to make the difficulty (of a by many considered already hard Mod) too steep for newer players, Kill Teams is an optional install for the more experienced players seeking a tougher challenge.
To install it, choose the **Kill Teams** option under **Enemy Support Lances** selection during the Roguetech installation.

### Superheavy 'Mechs Rework (Optional) - *Run, you fools!*

Superheavy Mechs have gone through a major rework to make them more viable and interesting to play. Besides updating the current ones, a large amount of new Roguetech custom designs have also been added to expand this area of the gameplay.

All Superheavy Mechs are part of the optional installation package with the name 'Superheavys', so to try them out make sure to select it during install.

The base **Superheavys** package contains around 100 mechs, most being generic to moderately advanced. 
For more interesting and unique designs, including a number of Superheavy only rare equipment and weapons - such as the *Helical Railgun*, the *Ion Cannon* and *Rotary LRM* launchers - the **Experimental Weapons** installation package contains another 50 designs. 
Some other designs are part of other packages, like **Quicsell** for the really weird but cheap Superheavy, **RISCtech** for highly advanced Inner Sphere versions and **Urbocalypse**; because you know you want the largest Urbie there is - the *Urban King*.

The list below is a summary of the major changes done to superheavy 'Mechs:

* The number of slots and hardpoints in each location of the 'Mech has been increased.
* They now receive less movement penalty in forests, rough or rubble terrain, but does not benefit from roads.
* They are now susceptible to knockdown when firing large weapons unless braced, but at a decreased chance compared to standard 'Mechs. The higher the tonnage, the less the risk, with the 200 ton 'Mechs totally immune.
* Armor is more efficient due to the ability to mount more of it, a flat +20% bonus to all locations except the head, which instead gets +100% bonus to make them harder to head shot.
* Due to their sheer size, they are more stable and therefore take less stability damage.
* As any MechWarrior piloting such a large 'Mech feels like the king of the world, they get a permanent +2 bonus to Guts as long as they remain in the 'Mech.
* A new fixed item type, "Superheavy Frame", is mounted in the Center Torso of all Superheavy 'Mechs in various sizes based on the 'Mech tonnage. This item will list the major superheavy specific buffs of the 'Mech.
* Superheavy Structure, Gyro and Stealth-type of armor have been added, standard 'Mech versions are not compatible.
* Superheavy equipment, Mechs and Mech parts have been added to faction stores and will appear after two years of in-game time.
* Certain planets have been given the new tag *Superheavy Industry*, and will now sell Superheavy equipment and Mechs produced on that planet after two years of in-game time. These stores generally have a friendly or honored reputation requirement for the items to appear.

More work around Superheavy Mechs will continue in the future, such as adding more contracts, flashpoints and similar content for them.

### Equipment and weapon changes - *The salt must flow*

##### Missile Ammunition
Ammunition for Inner Sphere and Clan missile launchers have been split to be more like in-lore and balance the launchers out. Clan ammunition will generally be harder to find, like the Clan launchers, but most of the time have more interesting statistics. As a result of this split, most specialty ammunition is no longer available on Clan launchers - at this time only Inferno, Swarm, Thunder and Artemis IV are available. Society launchers will also use their own ammunition from now on.

This change affects SRM, LRM, MRM standard launchers, as well as SRM Streak launchers. LRM Streak launchers are already Clan only, so was not changed.  RISC MML launchers have also been switched to use Clan ammunition.

##### Heavy Rotary Autocannons
HRACs have been removed, as they served no real purpose and were not balanced properly. RISCtech Autocannons and the Clan RAC/10 and RAC/20 now share ammunition, as the Clan ones are experimental versions based of the RISC.

##### Heavy MRM
All Heavy MRM launchers have been converted into Superheavy 'Mech only weapons, as they were too strong for their weapons class and intended profile.

##### Neural Interfaces / Pain Shunt
A new Neural Implant trait has been added for pilots.
Pilots without Neural Implants *can not* pilot a Mech with an always-on DNI cockpit, and cockpits with an activatable component will not provide any benefits when activated.
Neural Implants can be installed via a special surgery that can be purchased as a service in shops in Clan and WoB space, as well as Gamesworlds. Some Ronin pilots come with Neural Implants already installed.

##### Airlift / Crane
A new feature to airlift or lift units by crane has been added. So far only a single transport airship and the Loader King IndustrialMech have this feature. It allows the unit to lift any other unit on the battlefield, within its tonnage limitation, and then put it down - or throw it down if enemy. The lifted units can still fire, but not move as long as they are lifted.

### Operation Revival (Optional) - *New unofficial Content*
Based on the Zhukov series of Alternative Universe TRO's made by *Sharlin* (https://thezhukovau.wordpress.com/), this submod adds a selection of new Clan Mechs and Tanks primarily for the Hell's Horses. Highlights include a speedy UAC/20 hover tank, a 100 ton tank with 90 LRM's and a series of refits of frontline OmniMechs. 
**Used with original creators permission.**

### General Changes - *To keep ya on yer toes*

##### Anti Air Stance
All pilots got new ability called **AA Stance**, which can be used instead of attacking. Movement is still available after enabling it.
Many weapons have a new stat **AA Factor**, which is used to calculate anti-air capabilities when an *Airstrike* is about to land as follow:
The **AA Factor** of all weapons on all player mechs in **AA Stance** is added up and then divided by the number of player units on the field. The resulting value is the chance that the strafing fighter will not be able to attack any given unit in the strafe zone.

>   *Example*: You have 8 units. Two units are in **AA Stance**, one with a combined **AA Factor** of 250% and one with 150%. 250+150= 400 / 8 =50, so there is 50% chances that the strafing fighter will not attack your units in the strike zone.

The further increase the chance to prevent airstrikes, there are FCSs, Quirks and BC modules which further multiples the **AA Factor** value. As the AI does not understand how to use this equipment, it can only be bought in shops and will not appear in salvage.

##### Mech Hardpoints

All Mech's have gone through a hardpoint rebalance to bring them more in line with what we envision their roles to be. Superheavy Mechs got the largest benefit, greatly increasing their number of hardpoints.

##### Unit Cost
All Mechs and Vehicles costs have been reworked, in most cases resulting in a slight increase for 'Mechs and decrease for Vehicles. This change was made to address the fact that using vehicles as pure direct to sell loot was too good a tactic.

##### DLC Installation Options

During the Roguetech installation through the launcher you no longer have to choose which DLC you own. Instead, it will be autodetected as the game is started and only content which you have access to will be enabled.

##### Protomechs Converted to Core Mod
The previously optional *Protomechs* mod has been added into the core install, making them always available.

##### Internal Folder Restructure
We have adapted new, cleaner folder structure for how the Mod is set up - both the source and installed version. This will have a major impact on any Mods that build on top of Roguetech or tools. However, we feel with the new structure it is easier to keep track of things and maintain the Mod.

##### Career Backgrounds
* Added Test Subject.  Neural Implant!  Random Protomech!
* Updated Soldier.  No longer completely at the mercy of RNGesus.  Added the choice of an energy, ballistic or missile weapon to the day 2 lootbox event.  Review your lance before advancing a day!

##### Misc Fixes
* Added new Quicsell Outlet stores, with the best deals of the Galaxy!
* Sniper, Thumper and Long Tom Oneshot versions can no longer use external ammunition.
* As usual the release contains countless small fixes, tweaks and changes - far too many to list here.

### Questions and Bugs
As always, we are just a small team of volunteers working on this Mod and we don't have the time or resources to test new releases fully. Since this is a quite large release, the chance for bugs or unclear features is considerable.
We therefore ask that any encountered bugs be reported through our ticket system on our Discord by the **!openticket** command, and larger questions should be brought to the [#questions-and-answers](https://discord.com/channels/565106671693856778/565107929062309888) channel on Discord.

Our wiki will be updated with the new information, but this might not happen at the exact time of the launch of the release, so please have some patience.

**Please do not contact our crew directly, as that will only make us even less efficient.**
