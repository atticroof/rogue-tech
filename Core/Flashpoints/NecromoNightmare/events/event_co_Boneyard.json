Originally a day to remember the dead, it transitioned into a holiday where Terran children would dress up in costumes and go door to door to be given treats, usually in the form of candy.\u201D\r\n\r\nYou look at Dr Murad, \u201Cso what is the Trick?\u201D\r\n\r\nDr Murad smiles, \u201CSome residences would try to scare the children or play pranks on them and what not.\u201D\r\n\r\nYou ponder this information, \u201CSo, there are two access doors on the dropship, one for Trick and one for Treat.
