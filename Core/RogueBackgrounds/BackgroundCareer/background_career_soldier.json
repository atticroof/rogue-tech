  "Intro": "On an ill-fated mission, you were caught behind enemy lines and separated from your lance. Raju happened to be on patrol nearby, and he launched a daring rescue.

  "BioDescription": "You signed up for your local militia as soon as you came of age. While it wasn't glamorous, the life of a soldier suited you just fine. Things took a turn for the worse several years deep, however, and you found yourself burnt out on a gruelling campaign against local pirates who were conspicuously more armed than intelligence would've had you believe. You toughed through it, but swore you'd never commit to ops that you weren't in control of any longer, and founded your own mercenary company far away from the little speck you once called home.\r\n"
