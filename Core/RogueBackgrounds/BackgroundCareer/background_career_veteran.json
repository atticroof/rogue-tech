  "BioDescription": "Through many years of exceptional service, you found yourself shortlisted for a strike against Clan Smoke Jaguar - Operation DAMOCLES. Along with three other Second Star League veterans, you fought your way through the Smoke Jaguar chain of command, salvaging what 'Mechs you could along the way. In the final confrontation with the would-be leader of the Clan, your salvaged 'Mech was destroyed, but you were ultimately successful. Now, with your Bushwacker in tow, you think it's time for something a little quieter.\r\n"
