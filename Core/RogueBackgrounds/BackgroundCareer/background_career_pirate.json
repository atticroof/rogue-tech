  "OptionDescription": "Tired of living under the authority of others, you fell in with a local pirate gang in the [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreRimwardPeriphery],Rimward Periphery]]. It was an unruly crew, but an effective one - roaming the Periphery afforded your outfit with a steady supply of poorly defended merchant caravans and supply depots to prey upon. While raids did occasionally devolve into combat, you quickly learned that successful piracy is mostly about being in the right place, at the right time, with the right threats and a good show of force.\r\n\r\n+1 [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[StatMechWarriorGuts],Guts]]",
  "Intro": "After years of roaming the Frontier, your outfit's luck eventually ran out, landing you in an [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreAuriganCoalition],Aurigan Coalition]] prison. Hearing of your bad turn of fortune, Raju dragged you out of jail, giving you a second chance under his mentorship. After heavy rehabilitation, you proved your worth and were inducted into the [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreHouseArano],House Arano]] Royal Guard.\r\n\r\nSo it is that you find yourself reunited with your old mentor, preparing your ancestral [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreAncestralBlackjack],Blackjack]] for guard duty on the coronation day of the [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreKameaArano],Lady Kamea Arano]]â€¦",
  "BioDescription": "The school of hard knocks is for people who think that the only way to the top of the food chain is brute force. Officer training school is for the people who <i>know</i> the only way to the top of the food chain is brute force <i>applied by people under your command</i>. You graduated, did a brief stint in the organised military, dropped out, had a jaunt through the private sector, and now you find yourself at the head of your own mercenary company, with a whole slew of people ready to do the brute force for you.\r\n"
