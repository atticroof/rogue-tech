  "BioDescription": "In the Clans' mad scramble to find suitable pilots for the ProtoMech project, you were among those selected for experimentation. While you failed to meet the frankly absurd conditions of the program, you became adept at piloting the unusual machines. Discarded once you were deemed useless, you took to the great expanse of space and landed yourself a comfortable job at the head of a mercenary company, ready to put your unconventional skills to use.\r\n"
