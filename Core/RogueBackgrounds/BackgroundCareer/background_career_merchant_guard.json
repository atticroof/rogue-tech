  "OptionDescription": "You signed on as a guard for a small trading guild, providing security as the guild's caravan made trading runs between the [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreInnerSphere],Inner Sphere]] and the [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreRimwardPeriphery],Periphery]]. It was a largely uneventful life, but you were able to put your MechWarrior skills to good use in the occasional scuffle with pirates and uncooperative local governments.\r\n\r\n+1 [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[StatMechWarriorPiloting],Piloting]]",
  "Intro": "While escorting a supply caravan to a small outpost on the outskirts of the [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreAuriganReach],Aurigan Reach]], you were set upon by pirates and left for dead. Raju happened to be visiting the capital city and picked up your distress call. Upon rescuing you, he offered you a job in the [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreHouseArano],House Arano]] Royal Guard.\r\n\r\nSo it is that you find yourself reunited with your old mentor, preparing your ancestral [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreAncestralBlackjack],Blackjack]] for guard duty on the coronation day of the [[DM.BaseDescriptionDefs[LoreKameaArano],Lady Kamea Arano]]â€¦",
  "BioDescription": "You've spent most of your lift running some kind of grift. Hell, even getting MechWarrior training was something of a happy accident. A shame that your Lyran mentor at the time wasn't too thrilled when you tried to pay him D-Bills. Once all that was settled (it wasn't), you left (fled) your way to brighter prospects, sprinkling a little cash here and there to grease the wheels and buy your way to the head of a small mercenary company. What is it they say? War is business?\r\n"
