  "Details": "The Bushwacker is a medium BattleMech weighing in at 55 tons. Full scale production of the Bushwacker began in 3053 during the Clan Invasion. While the design existed for several years prior, it was plagued with issues, ranging from cramped controls to intermittent system failure due to the fusion reactor's proximity to sensitive electronics. Despite this, the narrow profile of the Bushwacker proved invaluable at deflecting enemy fire, and against all odds it became a champion of the Inner Sphere against the invading Clans.",
