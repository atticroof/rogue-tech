  "Name": "Snub-Nose Particle Projector Cannon",
  "Details": "Produced in limited numbers in 2785, the Snub-Nose Particle Projector Cannon, or Snub-Nose PPC, is a large energy weapon which fires a concentrated stream of protons or ions. Unlike standard PPCs, the Snub-Nose variety were designed to be used at short range. In addition to being able to slag nearly a ton of armor in a single shot, PPCs also scramble enemy electronics. This comes with the drawback of high heat production, and recoil, which is notably uncommon amongst energy weapons.",
