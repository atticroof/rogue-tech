  "Details": "The Quikscell Company is known as the Quicksell Company, Quickscell Company, Quicsell Company, and <i>many</i> other variations, changing names frequently to avoid lawsuits and weasel out of small print. While an immediately recognisable name throughout the Inner Sphere, it is not for good reasons - Quikscell goods are notoriously low quality and are mass produced to flood the market.",
