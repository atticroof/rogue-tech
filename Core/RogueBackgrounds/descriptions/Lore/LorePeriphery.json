  "Name": "The Periphery",
  "Details": "The Periphery is a comparatively sparsely populated region of space that encircles the Inner Sphere, beginning some 500 light years from Terra. Worlds within the Periphery are typically less technologically advanced than those within in Inner Sphere proper, but commerce still thrives. Over the centuries, a handful of strong Periphery states, such as the Magistracy of Canopus and the Taurian Concordat, have emerged with a fierce independence.",
