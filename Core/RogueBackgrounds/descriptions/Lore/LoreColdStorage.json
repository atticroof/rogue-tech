  "Name": "Cold Storage",
  "Details": "When BattleMechs or other vehicles are not planned to see use in some time, they are commonly placed in \"cold storage\", or \"mothballed\". To reduce maintenance costs, the unit in question is stripped down to its bare essentials and kept in designated storage containers. While this does make maintenance practically a non-issue, it can take several hours or even days to prepare a stored unit for deployment.",
