  "Name": "Double Heat Sink",
  "Details": "Double heat sinks are, as the name implies, twice as effective per ton as standard \"single\" heatsinks, albeit at the cost of two additional critical slots. Installing double heat sinks into a 'Mech requires the engine to support them. This is done by installing a double heat sink kit to the engine housing of the 'Mech. A 'Mech may only mount one type of heat sink, which is dictated by the engine kit installed.",
