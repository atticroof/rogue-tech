    "Details" : "<b>Gunnery</b> determines chance to hit with ranged weapons. In addition, it mitigates the chance of weapons jamming or misfiring, as well as increasing the chance to clear jams should they occur.\n\n<b>Piloting</b> increases melee hit chance and non-'Mech vehicle movement speed. It also reduces initiative variance and equipment failure chance.\n\n<b>Tactics</b> increases initative, sensor rolls, and offsets the accuracy penalty of Offensive Push. It also reduces the initiative penalty when a unit Reserves and the Resolve cost of abilities.\n\n<b>Guts</b> increases Resolve generation and injury resistance, mitigates initiative loss when the MechWarrior is the target of a melee attack or is injured, and reduces the likelihood of Overheating effects, such as ammo explosions or forced shutdown. Guts also reduces the chance of equipment failure or misfire causing damage to components.",
