  "Name" : "ProtoMech",
  "Details": "Created by Clan Smoke Jaguar in an attempt to ease the strain on resources placed upon the Clans by occupying the Inner Sphere post-invasion. The ProtoMech is a fusion between Clan Elemental Battle Armor and conventional BattleMechs. While roughly one-tenth the mass of a BattleMech, ProtoMechs are capable of carrying comparable firepower when deployed in Stars of five units. Neural interfaces and cramped cockpits mean that only specific candidates from the Clan eugenics programs are viable pilots.",
