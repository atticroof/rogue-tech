He looks out of breath.\n\n\"There's a problem, Boss,\" he says, leaning on a nearby console to catch his breath.\n\n\"Go on,\" you instruct, quirking a brow.\n\nHe goes onto explain the dilemma - while, yes, your old command vehicle was still around, there's been no small amount of confusion on the ground. Records have been lost, found, copied wrong, lost again, copied from the copies, et cetera.\n\n\"So, the short of it is,\" Yang concludes, \"they have an [[DM.MechDefs[vehicledef_AWACS],AWACS Command VTOL]] and an [[DM.MechDefs[vehicledef_MOBILEHQ_ACM],Oracle Mobile HQ truck]], but they don't know which one actually belongs to you. The way I see it, we can just pick the one we want and they'll be none the wiser!",
